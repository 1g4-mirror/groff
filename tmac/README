Some hyphenation pattern files distributed with groff aren't part of groff
(for licensing reasons); this file lists them, together with some notes
regarding the copyright.

. The file `hyphen.us' is identical to the file `hyphen.tex', part of the
  TeX system written by Donald E. Knuth; the master file can be found at

    ftp://labrea.stanford.edu/pub/tex/dist/lib/hyphen.tex    .

  It has been renamed for consistency, i.e., to make patterns available
  under the filenames `hyphen.<language>', e.g. `hyphen.de' or `hyphen.uk'.

  See the file itself for a copyright notice.

. The file `hyphen.fr' contains the same patterns as the file `frhyph.tex'
  (for TeX), which can be found at

    http://dante.ctan.org/CTAN/language/hyphenation/frhyph.tex    .

  The patterns have been converted to a format groff can understand.
