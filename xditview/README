This is gxditview, a X11 previewer for groff based on MIT's xditview.
This version can be used with the output of gtroff -Tps as well as
with -TX75 and -TX100.  You will need X11R4 to install it.

See the file INSTALL in this directory for installation instructions.

xditview is copyrighted by MIT under the usual X terms (see
gxditiew.man); my changes to it are in the public domain.

Please report bugs to me.
