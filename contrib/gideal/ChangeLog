	* Project: Project `gideal' with starting version 0.9 without real
	running.

	* gideal.pl: Preprocessor for the `ideal language' for `groff'.
	This program doesn't work yet, it just displays all `ideal' lines
	in another way.

	* gideal.man: Man-page 1 for the preprocessor `gideal'.

	* ideal.man: This should be the man-page 7 for the `ideal'
	language in `groff'.  This language must first be included.

	* Makefile.sub: Taken over from `gperl' and changed.  No libdir is
	necessary now.

	* ChangeLog: This file is a contrib change-log for only
	`gideal'.
