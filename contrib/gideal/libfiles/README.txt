In this directory, there are stored a series of `ideal libfiles'.
They all come from the `ideal' documentation
     Computing Science Technical Report No. 103
     IDEAL Userâ€™s Manual - Christopher J. Van Wyk

Therein the name of the `libfile' files does not have an extension.
But we added the extension `.ideal' to each libfile file.

Only the libfile `arc' is lacking.  It's existence was mentioned, but
not given.  We collected useful information and wrote a new file
`arc.ideal'.
