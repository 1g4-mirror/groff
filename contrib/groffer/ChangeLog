	________________________________________________________________
	* release of groffer 0.6

	This is almost a complete rewrite since groffer 0.5 .
	________________________________________________________________
	* Documentation
	
	* groffer.man:
   	- Apply the changes done in www.tmac (.URL and .MTO)
	- Replace \fP by \f[].
	- Redesign and rewrite most macros.
	- Include the documentation for the new features.
	- Greatly enlarge section ENVIRONMENT
	- Add examples.

	* TODO:
	- Start a TODO file with several sections.

	* ChangeLog:
	Due to the many changes, shorten and rearrange the entries
	since groffer 0.5 .
	________________________________________________________________
	* Shell compatibility

	* groffer.sh:
	- Due to possible conflicts in old BSD versions, `[]' was
	  replaced by `test'; the `test' options `-a' and `-o' were
	  replaced by multiple calls of `test'.
	- Write interface to the `sed' command `s' to become
	  independent of the delimiter character.  Rewrite all text
	  manipulating function to use this new scheme.  The new
	  functions are named `string_*'.
	- `tr' is not needed any longer, replaced by `sed'.
	- `grep' is not needed any longer, mostly replaced by `case'.
	- Revision of test for `getopt'.
	- Remove `set -a'; explicitly export variables.
	- The only external programs used are POSIX `sed' and the
	  fallback to `apropos'.  All other program calls were
	  replaced by shell builtins and functions.
	
	________________________________________________________________
	* Cosmetics

	* groffer.sh:
	- Implement a prefix based naming scheme for local variables
	  and functions (OOP-like).
	- Introduce variables for white space (better readability with
	  $IFS).
	- Store the names of the processed filespecs into a variable
	  instead of a temporary file.
	- Error-prone shell constructions were replaced by functions
	  with a simple interface.
	- To avoid too long pipes, replace supercat() by do_fileargs();
	  every input file is handled independently.

	________________________________________________________________
	* New features:
	- Add support for more X devices (e.g. X75-12 and X100-12).
	- Add long option `--intermediate_output' to `-Z'.
	- Make the options for mode selection clobber each other.
	- Add option `--mode' with an argument having the following
	  values:
	  `X': force displaying in X, same as options `-X';
	  `tty': display with a pager on text terminal; same as `--tty';
	  `source', `default', `auto', etc.
	- Make the handling of the X mode like in groff (e.g. -X -Tps).
	- Make resolution for gxditview behave like groff (default
	  75 dpi).
	- Add environment variable $GROFFER_OPT to preset groffer
	  options.

	________________________________________________________________
	* implement most of the functionality of GNU `man'.

	- Add all `man' long options to groffer.
	- Add all `man' environment variables.
	- Parse and use content of `$MANOPT'.
	- The precedence of the options and environment variables
	  is regulated like in GNU `man'.
	- Force the option `--manpath' to have a colon-separated
	  argument like GNU `man'.
	- Support `man section name' calling convention.
	- Remove all dependencies on `man -w'.

	* groffer.sh:
	- Add the new features above.
	- Rewrite the search algorithm for man pages.
	- Remove searching with `man -w' (problems with space
	  characters in file names).
	- Fix and complement usage().
	- The filespec parsers gets a function of its own do_manpage().

	* groffer 0.5 (beta) released

	* groffer.man:
	- Fix hyphenation problems with macros describing options.
	- Fix the handling of some `-' characters.
	- Examples of shell commands now print in font CR instead of CB.
	- Remove documentation for option `-X'.
	- Add documentation for option `--dpi'.
	
	* groffer.sh:
	- New method for creating temporary files, based on process
	  IDs.  This is reliable enough and suitable for GNU and POSIX.
	- Run gxditview in a new shell instantiation for having a clean
    	  handling of the temporary files when running in the
	  background.
	- Revision of the retrieving method for the window title.
	- Empty input is now tolerated.
	- Export the variables that are set before the call of `set -a'.
	- Function usage() corrected and updated.
	- Unnecessary stuff removed.
	- Comments adjusted.
	- Pass option `-X' to groff, i.e. force X output with 75 dpi.
	- Implement option `--dpi' for setting the resolution for the X
	  viewer, which had already been documented in earlier versions.

2002-01-07  Bernd Warken  <bwarken@mayn.de>

	* groffer 0.4 (beta) released (as groff `contrib')
	
	* groffer.man:
	- New features documented.
	- Macros stream-lined.
	- Section EXAMPLES added.
	
	* groffer.sh:
	- System tests added/optimized.
	- Speed/memory optimizations by defining some shell functions
	  alternatively depending on the text results.
	- Use `gzip' for decompression instead of `zcat'.
	- Signal handling added for clean exiting by `trap'.
	- Temporary files exist only as long as necessary.
	- Setup of path for man-pages moved after the option parsing.
	- Fixed a bug in determining the path for man-pages.
	- Fixed a bug in the handling of non-groffer options.

	* New features:
	- New option --tty for forcing paging on text terminal.
	- New option --no-man for disabling the man-page feature.
	- Implement reserved POSIX -W feature to simulate long options.
	- gxditview is now run as a background process.
