TODO

Optimization:
- Optimize for speed (`case' instead of `sed' interface?).

Features:
- For each postprocessor, register its options for checking against -P.
  Maybe this should rather be done within groff.
- Support bzip.

Revision:
- Should there be a native implementation for `--apropos'?
- Revise the `--all' feature to better reflect GNU man.

Documentation:
- Write a README file.
- Document the search algorithm for man pages in both the `groffer.sh'
script and the man page `groffer.man'.
- In `groff.man', add more documentation for parts that were taken over
from GNU `man'.
- Some documentations for function definitions in `groffer' need an
update.
