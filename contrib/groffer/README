README

The `groffer' program is the easiest way to read documents written in
some `roff' language, such as the `man pages', the manual pages in
many operating systems.


Input

Input comes from either standard input or command line parameters that
represent names of exisiting roff files or standardized specifications
for searching man pages.  All of these can be compressed in a format
that is decompressible by `gzip', including `.gz', `bz2', and `.Z'.

`groffer' has many built-in `man' functionalities to find and read the
manual pages on UNIX and similar operating systems.  It accepts the
information from an installed `man' program, but tries to find a man
path by itself.

`groffer' bundles all filespec parameters into a single output file in
the same way as `groff'.  The disadvantage of this is that all file
name arguments must use the same groff language.  To change this, the
option parsing must be revised for large parts.  It seems that this
would create incompatibilities, so the actual option strategy is kept.


Output

All input is first sent to `grog' to determine the necessary groff
options and then to `groff'.  So no special `groff' arguments must be
given.  But all `groff' options can be specified when this seems to be
appropriate.

The following displaying modes for the output are available:
- Display formatted input with
-- the X roff viewer `gxditview',
-- a Prostcript viewer,
-- a PDF viewer,
-- a DVI viewer,
-- a web browser,
-- a pager in a text terminal (tty).
- Generate groff output on stdout without a viewer.
- Generate the troff intermediate output on standard output without
  postprocessing.
- Output the source code without any groff processing.
By default, the program tries to display with `gxditview' as graphical
device in X; on non-X text terminals, the `tty' text mode with a pager
is tried by default.


Compatibility

`groffer' is a shell script.  It should run on any POSIX or Bourne
style shell that supports shell functions with local variables.


Mailing lists

For reporting bugs of `groffer', groff's free mailing list
<bug-groff@gnu.org> can be used.  For a general discussion, the
mailing list <groff@gnu.org> is more useful; see the `README' file in
the top directory of the `groff' source package for more details on
these mailing lists.
