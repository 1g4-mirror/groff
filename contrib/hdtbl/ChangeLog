	* groff_hdtbl.man: Simplify macros for switching from and to the `C'
	font family, as suggested by Tadziu Hoffmann.

	* groff_hdtbl.man: Completely revised again.
	`Normalize' font usage: Add macros similar to `.B' and `.BI' for
	switching from and to the `C' font family, instead of using \f.
	Fix appearance of macro syntax descriptions.
	Add more quotation characters.
