groff 1.18
----------

Mom version 1.1.1b is now part of groff.

Release 1.1.1
-------------

***CHANGES***
Main macro file renamed to om.tmac, in keeping with current groff
policy.

Now okay to use groff mailing list for mom-related posts

***NEW***
Toggle macro -- BR_AT_LINE_KERN.  When on, automatically deposits
a break whenever .RW or .EW are invoked.  Very useful when kerning
whole lines of rag copy.

***NEW***
Toggle macro -- PAGENUM_ON_FIRST_PAGE.  Normally, when FOOTERS are
being used instead of HEADERS, mom doesn't print the page number at
the top of the first page of a doc, or the first page of collated docs.
PAGENUM_ON_FIRST_PAGE allows user to get mom to put the page number on
"first" pages if that's desired.

***NEW***
Macro -- BREAK_QUOTE -- to deal with problem of footnoted quotes and
blockquotes that cross a page or column.

***NEW***
New argument to AUTOLEAD -- FACTOR.  With FACTOR, you can, if you
wish, enter a factor by which AUTOLEAD multiplies the point size when
calculating lead automatically.

Improvements
------------

PAPER now has a much larger selection of common paper sizes.

\*[ALD], \*[RLD], \*[FP] and \*[BP] now accept increments of quarter
points (expressed as decimal fractions).  \*[RLD1.75], for example,
reverses 1-3/4 points up on the line.

HEADER_SIZE now available to PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE.  This was necessary
to deal with the problem of excessively long HEADER_LEFT, _CENTER or
_RIGHT strings.

Fixes
-----

T_MARGIN -- can be set before or after LS or AUTOLEAD
SS       -- remains constant regardless of WS
WS       -- no longer affects SS
TI       -- now works as expected even when called while another indent
            type is in effect
COLLATE  -- small fixes

Broken .RW and .EW fixed.

String tabs now behave properly when set from within tabs.

UNDERLINE_QUOTES (for PRINTSTYLE TYPEWRITE) are now, in fact, on by
default as the docs state.
