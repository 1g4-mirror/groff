HEADERS/FOOTERS
---------------
Create two new macros -- HEADER/FOOTER_1 and HEADER/FOOTER_2 --
in case user wants a single (instead of 3-part) user-designed
header/footer.  Default will be centered, but since I'll process this
style of header/footer in a diversion, user can change quad direction.
The idea behind _1 and _2 is that the user may want different headers
for recto and verso pages.  Therefore, when recto/verso is on, _1 will
go on rectos, _2 on versos.

CONTROL MACROS -- _INDENT
--------------
Let user be able to enter decimal fractions as the argument to _INDENT
control macros, or, instead, let user be able to enter absolute
values with a unit of measure in addition to current behaviour,
which is relative.

ENDNOTES
--------
Not entirely sure of the most flexible way to set these up.  And, to be
honest, not sure how essential they are to mom's target users.

LISTS
-----
Possbility of indented, nested lists, html-style.  Options for numbered,
alpha-ed, bulleted, dashed.  Again, not sure how useful these would be
for mom's target users.  As things stand now, it's easy enough to
set up lists with string tabs or hanging indents.

BIBLIOGRAPHY
------------
Thinking about macros to *assist* in user-written bibliographies (i.e.
not biblios that get generated automatically at the ends of docs).  Style
considerations are a nightmare, though.
