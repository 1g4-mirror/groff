TODO items for pdfmark.tmac
===========================

Add copyright information to PDF documentation.

--------

Add acknowledgements and trade mark ownership notifications
to PDF documentation.

--------

Provide documentation in man page and texinfo formats.

--------

Add comments in spdf.tmac, to clarify its operation.
Also add commentary in pdfmark.tmac, to clarify operation of
recent changes.

--------

Make Makefile generic, so 'configure' can resolve target
system dependencies.

--------

Improve Makefile.sub, to integrate pdfmark.tmac installation
into a regular groff build.  Add it to groff's Makefile.in.

--------

Provide a `pdfmark' script (or call it `groff2pdf'?) which
actually converts a groff input file to pdf, and which
takes care of the necessary intermediate steps to handle
PDF marks.
